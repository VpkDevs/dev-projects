# Markdown File Linting & Validation Summary

## Task Completed: Step 5 - Lint & Validate Content

### Overview
Successfully implemented automated linting and validation for all `what-belongs-here.md` files in the project directory structure.

### Validation Criteria Implemented

The linting tools check that every markdown file:

1. **Contains all five required sections in order:**
   - Category Definition
   - Inclusion Criteria
   - Examples That Belong
   - Examples That Do NOT Belong
   - Where to Move Non-Matching Projects

2. **Uses 3-5 bullets in the criteria section:**
   - Minimum 3 bullets required
   - Maximum 5 bullets recommended
   - At least 3 must be required criteria (not optional)

3. **References at least one example and one counter-example:**
   - Examples must be properly formatted (e.g., `1. **name**: description`)
   - Counter-examples must include "Should be in:" notes

### Tools Created

#### 1. Python Linter (`lint_markdown_files.py`)
- Cross-platform Python script
- Colored console output with symbols (✓, ✗, ⚠)
- Detailed error and warning reporting
- Generates `lint_report.txt` for manual review

#### 2. PowerShell Linter (`Lint-MarkdownFilesSimple.ps1`)
- Windows PowerShell script
- Alternative for Windows environments
- Same validation logic as Python version
- Generates `lint_report_ps.txt` for manual review

### Validation Results

**All 10 markdown files validated successfully:**

| Category | File | Status | Issues |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| analyze | what-belongs-here.md | ✓ Valid | ⚠ Placeholder text |
| archived | what-belongs-here.md | ✓ Valid | ⚠ Placeholder text |
| core | what-belongs-here.md | ✓ Valid | ⚠ Placeholder text |
| create | what-belongs-here.md | ✓ Valid | ⚠ Placeholder text |
| enterprise | what-belongs-here.md | ✓ Valid | ⚠ Placeholder text |
| experimental | what-belongs-here.md | ✓ Valid | ⚠ Placeholder text |
| personal | what-belongs-here.md | ✓ Valid | ⚠ Placeholder text |
| professional | what-belongs-here.md | ✓ Valid | ⚠ Placeholder text |
| specialize | what-belongs-here.md | ✓ Valid | ⚠ Placeholder text |
| unsorted | what-belongs-here.md | ✓ Valid | ⚠ Placeholder text |

### Summary Statistics
- **Total files checked:** 10
- **Valid files:** 10 (100%)
- **Invalid files:** 0 (0%)
- **Files with warnings:** 10 (100%)

### Warnings Identified

All files contain the following placeholder text that should be replaced:
- "Example 4" and "Example 5" in the Examples section
- "Misplaced Project 3" and "Misplaced Project 4" in counter-examples
- "To be determined" text in the "Should be in:" notes

### Usage Instructions

#### Python Linter:
```bash
# Basic validation
python lint_markdown_files.py

# Validate specific directory
python lint_markdown_files.py /path/to/directory
```

#### PowerShell Linter:
```powershell
# Basic validation
.\Lint-MarkdownFilesSimple.ps1

# Detailed output
.\Lint-MarkdownFilesSimple.ps1 -Detailed

# Custom report file
.\Lint-MarkdownFilesSimple.ps1 -ReportFile "custom_report.txt"
```

### Next Steps

While all files are structurally valid, the following improvements are recommended:

1. **Replace placeholder examples** with actual project names from each category
2. **Update "To be determined"** text with specific category recommendations
3. **Review counter-examples** to ensure they provide clear guidance

### Conclusion

The linting and validation system is fully operational and has successfully verified that all markdown files meet the structural requirements. The system flags violations for manual review through detailed reports, making it easy to identify and fix any issues that arise in the future.
