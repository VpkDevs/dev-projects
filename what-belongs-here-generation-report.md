### Implementation Details

- **Script Created:** `generate_what_belongs_here.py`
- **Data Sources Used:**
  - `category_mapping.json` - Contains category definitions and criteria
  - `category_template.md` - Template with placeholders
  - `category_metadata_collection.json` - Additional metadata

### Template Substitutions Applied

Each generated file includes:

- **Category Name and Definition** - Clear description of the category's purpose
- **Inclusion Criteria** - 3-5 specific criteria for projects that belong
- **Examples That Belong** - Real project examples with descriptions
- **Examples That Don't Belong** - Counter-examples with correct placement advice
- **Alternative Categories** - Guidance for relocating misplaced projects
- **Metadata** - Last updated date and template version

### Key Features

- ✅ All placeholders properly substituted with relevant data
- ✅ Intelligent parsing of counter-examples from mapping data
- ✅ Dynamic generation of alternative category suggestions
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing data with appropriate defaults
- ✅ UTF-8 encoding for proper character support
- ✅ Overwrite capability for existing files

### Verification

All files have been verified to exist in their correct locations:
- Each category directory now contains a `what-belongs-here.md` file
- Files are properly formatted Markdown
- Content is contextually appropriate for each category

## Next Steps

The `what-belongs-here.md` files are now available to:
1. Guide developers in organizing projects correctly
2. Serve as reference documentation for the categorization system
3. Help with future project migration and reorganization efforts
4. Maintain consistency across the development structure
