## ‚ùå **CLAIMS REQUIRING CORRECTION**

### 1. **40M+ Used Cars Sold Annually**
**Our Claim:** "40M+ used cars sold annually in US"
**Reality:** This figure appears inflated. Research shows:
- Total light vehicle sales (new + used): ~15.9M units in 2024
- Used car sales are typically 2-3x new car sales
- More realistic estimate: ~25-30M used cars annually

**Correction Needed:** Update to "25-30M+ used cars sold annually"

### 2. **60+ Hours Average Research Time**
**Our Claim:** "Average buyer researches for 60+ hours"
**Research Finding:** Could not verify this specific statistic from authoritative sources
**Status:** Unverified - need alternative source or remove

**Correction Needed:** Either find credible source or replace with "extensive research time" without specific hours

### 3. **TAM Calculation Issues**
**Our Claim:** "Our TAM: $3B+ (research/tools/services market)"
**Issue:** While total market is $1.5T+, the research/tools segment TAM needs better justification
**Research Finding:** U.S. motor vehicle and parts retail revenue was $1.532 trillion in 2023

**Correction Needed:** More conservative TAM estimate with detailed breakdown
